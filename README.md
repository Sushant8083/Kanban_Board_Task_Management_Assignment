Trello Clone with MERN Stack
Welcome to the Trello Clone project! This repository houses a Trello-like application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The project aims to provide users with a platform for managing tasks, projects, and more, inspired by the popular Trello application.

Overview
This Trello Clone project offers the following key features:

Board Creation and Management: Users can create boards to organize their tasks and projects. Each board acts as a container for various lists and cards.

List Management: Within each board, users can create lists. Lists represent different categories, phases, or steps of a project. They help in dividing tasks logically.

Card Creation and Tracking: Users can create cards within lists, representing individual tasks or items. Cards can be moved between lists to indicate progress.

Token-Based User Identification: Although the project currently doesn't feature full-fledged user authentication, it generates tokens for users upon interacting with the application. These tokens are utilized to associate user-specific data and activities within the application.

Data Persistence with MongoDB: User-generated data, including boards, lists, and cards, are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring that the data remains accessible across sessions.

How It Works
Token Generation: When a user interacts with the application, a token is generated and associated with that user's session. This token allows the application to identify and differentiate users.

Board Creation: Users can create boards, each of which acts as a unique workspace for organizing tasks and projects.

List and Card Management: Within each board, users can create lists to represent project phases or categories. Cards can then be created within lists to represent individual tasks.

Moving Cards: Users can interact with the cards by moving them between lists. This movement helps track the progress of tasks.

Data Storage: All user-generated data, including boards, lists, and cards, are stored in a MongoDB database. This ensures that the data persists even when the user logs out or closes the application.

User Authentication: Implementing user authentication to secure user accounts and data.

User Profiles: Allowing users to create profiles, customize settings, and manage their account information.

Real-Time Collaboration: Enabling real-time collaboration on boards and cards between multiple users.

UI/UX Improvements: Enhancing the user interface and experience to make the application more intuitive and visually appealing.

Mobile Responsiveness: Optimizing the application's design and layout for mobile devices.
